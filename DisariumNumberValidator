Disarium Numbers

A number is called a Disarium number if the sum of the powers of its digits equals the number itself. The digits are powered to their positions in the number.

For example:
Input: 135
Output: true
135 is a Disarium number because it equals to 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 (each digit powered to the position in the number).

Write a program to check if the user input is a Disarium number or not.

numChk = input()
numLen = len(numChk)
numLst = []

for x in range(0, numLen):
	numSep = int(numChk[x])
	numLst.append(numSep**(x+1))
	x+=1
	
if sum(numLst) == int(numChk):
    print(numChk + " is a Disarium number")
else:
    print(numChk + " is not a Disarium number")
